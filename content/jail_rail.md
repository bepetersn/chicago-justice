### How to Access the Data

Some Jail data is visualized by the [26th and California Project](http://26thandcalifornia.recoveredfactory.net), and corresponding raw data is available through the [Cook County Jail API](https://github.com/sc3/cookcountyjail/wiki/API-guide) project. Both of these projects in turn get their information from the single inmate search function of the [Cook County Inmate Locator](http://www2.cookcountysheriff.org/search2/).

To access greater or more specific data from the Cook County Jail, you need to [file a request for data under Illinois' Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)](http://www.statesattorney.org/about_the_office.html). You will need to send an email including: **(1)** *your name and contact information*, along with **(2)** *a description of the records you are requesting*. Please try to be reasonably specific for the data you are looking for so that they can more easily process your request.

### National Models for Releasing Justice Data  

##### King County (Washington)  

[King County, Washington](https://data.kingcounty.gov/browse?&tags=jail+inmate), is far and away the leader of the pack when it comes to making jail data available and useful. Many counties throughout the US allow you to visit a website to search for the status of a single inmate. Some sites also offer some analysis of the cost to house jail detainees and population analysis over time.  

King County is the only known place offering structured data about its inmate population. King County uses Socrata, the same system that powers the City of Chicago's data portal. You can use Socrata's tools to visualize the data online, but you can also download it to use for your own projects. It's not quite as easy to search for data about a single inmate, but it is far superior to any other county's site in making large amount of data about their detainees available for analysis.
